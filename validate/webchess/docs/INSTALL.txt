1) decompress webchess in a web-accessible directory
2) create the WebChess MySQL database, a user (similar to the sample user_permissions.txt in the tables folder) and the WebChess tables (using the SQL statements found in the tables folder) and give the WebChess user select, insert, update and delete priviledges
3) update the database settings in config.php to reflect the newly created MySQL database
4) update other settings in config.php as desired
